I can finally talk!! 

This is a great app! I'm an SLP working in rehab and home care. Not all our patients need or can afford a device that costs thousands. It is easy to use and family can easily learn how to customize it even more after they are trained. Because the app is affordable, it is easy to convince facilities and families to purchase it. I will always remember the first time my patient used it to say "I love you" to her son after years of saying only "Yes, yes!" Thank you for the wonderful tool!!
