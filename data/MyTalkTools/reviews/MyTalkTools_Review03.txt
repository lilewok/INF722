My Talk Tools 

Hi Everyone!! 

I have been in education for 20 + years serving as a teacher associate. I've held a state Paraeducator certificate since 2000. 

This will be my 6 th year working with a student who has intellectual and communication disabilities. We are now in High School. We have tried several communication tools and we were thrilled to find MYTALK TOOLS about 3 years ago!!!! 

I have been able to customize MyTalk boards for my student's use and unique needs. I don't have to weed through myriads of "stuff " to find what my student will/can use. 

These are some of the ways we use MyTalk Tools @ home, school and in community: 

order favorite foods when dining out 

Answer yes/no class questions as well as A,B,C,D,E options, and counting to 20. 

oral class reports 

Compliment and/or greet family, friends, class mates & staff 

Ask for help, bathroom, express feelings and needs 

She can tell others: 

favorite movies or movies she wants to watch 

about family, contact information, age and school she attends 

What recreational activities she enjoys 

About weekend activities
