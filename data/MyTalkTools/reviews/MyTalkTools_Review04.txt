SLP 

I have used MyTalk for my nonverbal clients for 4 years now. It has helped my clients become more independent at work and in the community. I use the professional workspace to quickly make communication cells on a variety of subjects (wants and needs, ordering in a restaurant, activities to choose from while at dayhab and at home, places to go in the community, etc.) Each board is individualized for every client. The professional workspace is a breeze to use. Any problems I have encountered (only a few times in the 4 years of use) have been quickly remedied by Bick or Kevin.
