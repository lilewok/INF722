wow, what a great app 
This is for my son, who's 26, has autism and is noverbal. He uses facilitated communication, but only with a few people. He was able to get himself past the stage of throwing his device or flipping it up into the facilitator's face, so he has earned himself an ipad. I only tried one other app before this one, but it was much less expensive and didn't do very much. This is really the perfect app for him. He could locate and tap his pictures independently, with no physical prompts. No training was required; he just jumped right in. I love how you can keep adding layers to the conversation. We use photos of his own possessions, his own body, and himself doing the different activities that he might request. For menu items, we use clipart from the actual restaurants. Commercial entities cannot do this because of copyright restrictions; that's why they end up with those infantile line drawings that the users hate so much. Importing photos from the ipad photo album, his facebook page, and the restaurant websites was easy and fast. You can get friends to add in the voice, or use the synth voice that is already there. I programmed everything in without having to go to a user manual even once, that's how intuitive it is. You people really did your homework.
