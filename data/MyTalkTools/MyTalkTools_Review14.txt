A MUST!!!!! 

Amazing program! I am an AT Specialist and this program is amazing. It can obviously be used as a communication tool, but can also be customized for anything, including choice boards, IEP goals, schedules, and anything else you can imagine. 

The customer service for this app is also second to none. I have asked questions and the response is lightning quick. They are patient and kind when responding. And the fact that the program uses the cloud to back up the data is so much easier and well thought out than using another program that uses Dropbox. You simply put in your user name and password and your data is there. I cannot recommend this highly enough for those who work with special Ed students or those with disabilities. Also in my opinion the workspace is totally worth the money. It makes it so much easier to program the students devices using workspace. 

Once again this is amazing product and I highly recommend it.
