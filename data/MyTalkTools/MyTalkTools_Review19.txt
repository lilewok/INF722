Good app/not so good instructions 

I installed this app on my granddaughter's iPad. She is six and non verbal. Once I experimented with the app I found it was very easy to set up. The instructions were no help at all and when I tried to use the trial board website I was redirected to a form for my personal information. Once I saw I was unable to use the trial unless I provided my information I logged off and used the mobile app only.
