word
this
is
a
classroom
dream
come
true
i've
used
mytalktools
in
my
classroom
for
a
long
time
and
love
it
in
fact
it
just
keeps
getting
better
because
the
company
listens
to
its
users
and
keeps
adding
features
mytalk
is
perfect
for
teaching
and
assessing
my
students
on
the
lowest
one
percent
level
they
are
slow
learners
but
can
and
do
learn
as
a
music
teacher
mytalktools
is
the
only
app
that
can
make
djs
and
vjs
out
of
any
student
who
can
select
by
eye
gaze
or
touch
via
apple
tv
add
the
image
or
video
to
an
lcd
screen
and
pump
the
sound
through
a
sound
system
cool
additionally
mytalk
can
mimic
the
alternate
assessment
my
state
has
where
there
are
three
answers
and
if
a
student
selects
the
incorrect
answer
the
choice
disapears
allowing
the
student
to
try
again
from
two
choices
naturally
students
give
an
ipad
more
attention
than
the
boaring
black
and
white
line
drawings
used
for
testing
at
one
school
show
i
programmed
all
the
comments
that
an
mc
would
say
so
students
could
run
the
show
with
a
touch
of
a
finger
the
acapela
voice
was
so
good
that
someone
asked
who
the
mc
was
when
she
watched
the
show
on
closed
circuit
tv
the
cameraman
didn't
pick
up
the
students
so
she
didn't
have
an
idea
is
was
students
using
mytalktools
i've
even
made
a
board
for
myself
in
case
of
the
event
that
one
day
i
might
need
to
communicate
let's
say
where
pain
is
but
can't
talk
as
magical
as
it
sounds
people
with
a
degenerative
condition
can
bank
their
voice
for
the
future
the
free
version
will
give
you
an
idea
of
if
it's
for
you
because
mytalktools
has
so
many
features
there
is
a
learning
curve
but
the
tutorials
are
well
made
start
small
and
your
find
before
long
you
will
be
full
of
implimentation
ideas
good
luck
and
have
fun
june
2016
update
mytalktools
had
continued
to
listen
to
its
users
through
the
years
there
are
more
features
than
ever
and
they
are
easier
to
use
to
the
novice
mytalktools
may
not
look
like
much
from
its
simple
framework
the
beauty
is
the
simplicity
of
use
for
the
board
creator
and
the
end
user
once
the
basics
are
mastered
there
are
lots
of
attribuites
to
explore
i
love
being
able
to
save
units
of
work
throughout
the
school
year
and
return
to
them
later
with
the
option
to
edit
them
to
meet
new
students
needs
more
updates
mytalktools
can
mimic
the
expensive
dangerous
infrared
eye
gaze
systems
they
can
cause
seizures
by
using
the
camera
that
faces
the
user
to
look
for
eyes
dwelling
on
a
cell
or
looking
for
an
eye
wink
movement
to
use
as
a
mouse
click
it
has
been
working
for
my
students
with
severe
cognitive
disabilities
and
physical
challenges
they
get
so
excited
then
they
can
actually
control
something
note
that
one
needs
good
lighting
and
a
background
that
isn't
busy
visually
mytalktools
is
still
my
go
to
tool
in
my
classroom
thank
you
very
much
for
creating
this
free
version
i
know
that
you
guys
have
been
pioneers
on
creating
apps
for
individuals
with
disabilities
as
a
speech
therapist
i
have
to
recognize
the
importance
of
giving
a
voice
to
those
who
struggle
with
communication
at
a
affable
price
you
guys
are
definitely
revolutionizing
this
field
by
providing
affordable
access
to
aac
way
to
go
i
can
finally
talk
this
is
a
great
app
i'm
an
slp
working
in
rehab
and
home
care
not
all
our
patients
need
or
can
afford
a
device
that
costs
thousands
it
is
easy
to
use
and
family
can
easily
learn
how
to
customize
it
even
more
after
they
are
trained
because
the
app
is
affordable
it
is
easy
to
convince
facilities
and
families
to
purchase
it
i
will
always
remember
the
first
time
my
patient
used
it
to
say
i
love
you
to
her
son
after
years
of
saying
only
yes
yes
thank
you
for
the
wonderful
tool
giving
dad
his
voice
back
i
scoured
the
internet
for
an
app
to
help
my
dad
communicate
despite
his
aphasia
i
am
not
even
sure
how
i
stumbled
on
this
app
it
was
a
little
tricky
at
first
getting
it
set
up
but
i
went
on
a
computer
and
within
a
few
minutes
i
was
happy
to
be
on
my
way
to
setting
it
up
i
can
make
changes
remotely
and
love
how
my
mom
and
dad
can
benefit
from
the
changes
immediately
i
also
appreciate
a
free
30
day
trial
to
see
if
this
continues
to
be
a
perfect
fit
can
not
use
app
i
was
referred
by
my
son
speech
therapist
but
app
is
not
allowing
me
to
create
an
account
a
must
amazing
program
i
am
an
at
specialist
and
this
program
is
amazing
it
can
obviously
be
used
as
a
communication
tool
but
can
also
be
customized
for
anything
including
choice
boards
iep
goals
schedules
and
anything
else
you
can
imagine
the
customer
service
for
this
app
is
also
second
to
none
i
have
asked
questions
and
the
response
is
lightning
quick
they
are
patient
and
kind
when
responding
and
the
fact
that
the
program
uses
the
cloud
to
back
up
the
data
is
so
much
easier
and
well
thought
out
than
using
another
program
that
uses
dropbox
you
simply
put
in
your
user
name
and
password
and
your
data
is
there
i
cannot
recommend
this
highly
enough
for
those
who
work
with
special
ed
students
or
those
with
disabilities
also
in
my
opinion
the
workspace
is
totally
worth
the
money
it
makes
it
so
much
easier
to
program
the
students
devices
using
workspace
once
again
this
is
amazing
product
and
i
highly
recommend
it
teachers
of
students
with
severe
cognitive
disabilities
need
this
one
i
have
used
mytalktools
in
my
classroom
for
two
years
my
colleagues
have
noticed
how
much
more
their
students
interact
with
curriculum
content
both
on
an
independent
level
and
a
supported
level
they
have
worked
at
getting
ipads
and
this
app
into
their
classroom
too
do
go
through
all
the
detailed
training
because
this
is
a
very
powerful
tool
and
can
do
a
lot
without
investing
a
bit
of
time
to
understand
it
you
can
miss
parts
that
may
be
very
useful
with
all
the
push
to
evaluate
teachers
on
student
achievement
mytalktools
can
be
a
wonderful
tool
to
help
with
communication
and
assessment
of
any
curriculum
if
a
student
doesn't
already
have
a
communication
device
or
alternate
mode
of
communication
try
it
out
with
apple
tv
mirroring
on
your
lcd
projector
for
the
whole
class
to
follow
along
love
this
app
bick
pratt
and
his
team
of
professionals
have
given
one
of
my
students
a
voice
today
i
used
the
lite
version
with
my
non
verbal
student
just
to
see
his
face
light
up
when
he
pressed
his
picture
that
said
his
name
was
priceless
am
anxious
to
see
what
else
he
can
tell
me
with
his
new
voice
thanks
for
developing
an
easy
to
use
app
you
have
designed
it
perfectly
one
can
see
how
many
hours
you
have
put
into
developing
it
i
like
how
i
can
add
my
voice
and
own
pictures
from
my
photos
the
symbolix
and
public
library
are
also
a
plus.i
also
like
how
the
tutorials
guide
you
through
the
process
my
talk
tools
rock
my
talk
tools
lite
i
am
a
speech
therapist
using
this
app
with
my
adult
patients
and
i
have
found
it
an
excellent
tool
to
serve
as
an
assistive
communication
device
or
as
visual
support
for
verbal
communication
it
is
easy
to
set
up
and
edit
and
makes
use
of
your
own
photos
internet
searches
or
icons
and
recorded
speech
or
text
to
speech
i
have
found
it
easy
to
teach
to
family
members
and
patients
themselves
the
technical
support
is
excellent
and
my
questions
have
been
answered
quickly
and
helpfully
i
have
used
the
workspace
to
set
up
boards
for
my
patients
which
has
been
extremely
useful
revolutionizes
my
classroom
i
cannot
say
enough
good
things
about
this
app
it
has
opened
doors
in
the
communication
realm
for
my
students
with
significant
disabilities
it
not
only
gives
my
students
a
voice
they
didn't
have
before
but
engages
them
in
learning
this
app
is
easy
to
use
and
has
countless
customization
options
customer
service
is
amazing
any
issue
i've
ever
had
has
been
swiftly
resolved
by
their
wonderful
staff
good
app
not
so
good
instructions
i
installed
this
app
on
my
granddaughter's
ipad
she
is
six
and
non
verbal
once
i
experimented
with
the
app
i
found
it
was
very
easy
to
set
up
the
instructions
were
no
help
at
all
and
when
i
tried
to
use
the
trial
board
website
i
was
redirected
to
a
form
for
my
personal
information
once
i
saw
i
was
unable
to
use
the
trial
unless
i
provided
my
information
i
logged
off
and
used
the
mobile
app
only
wow
what
a
great
app
this
is
for
my
son
who's
26
has
autism
and
is
noverbal
he
uses
facilitated
communication
but
only
with
a
few
people
he
was
able
to
get
himself
past
the
stage
of
throwing
his
device
or
flipping
it
up
into
the
facilitator's
face
so
he
has
earned
himself
an
ipad
i
only
tried
one
other
app
before
this
one
but
it
was
much
less
expensive
and
didn't
do
very
much
this
is
really
the
perfect
app
for
him
he
could
locate
and
tap
his
pictures
independently
with
no
physical
prompts
no
training
was
required
he
just
jumped
right
in
i
love
how
you
can
keep
adding
layers
to
the
conversation
we
use
photos
of
his
own
possessions
his
own
body
and
himself
doing
the
different
activities
that
he
might
request
for
menu
items
we
use
clipart
from
the
actual
restaurants
commercial
entities
cannot
do
this
because
of
copyright
restrictions
that's
why
they
end
up
with
those
infantile
line
drawings
that
the
users
hate
so
much
importing
photos
from
the
ipad
photo
album
his
facebook
page
and
the
restaurant
websites
was
easy
and
fast
you
can
get
friends
to
add
in
the
voice
or
use
the
synth
voice
that
is
already
there
i
programmed
everything
in
without
having
to
go
to
a
user
manual
even
once
that's
how
intuitive
it
is
you
people
really
did
your
homework
my
talk
tools
hi
everyone
i
have
been
in
education
for
20
years
serving
as
a
teacher
associate
i've
held
a
state
paraeducator
certificate
since
2000

will
be
my
6
th
year
working
with
a
student
who
has
intellectual
and
communication
disabilities
we
are
now
in
high
school
we
have
tried
several
communication
tools
and
we
were
thrilled
to
find
mytalk
tools
about
3
years
ago
i
have
been
able
to
customize
mytalk
boards
for
my
student's
use
and
unique
needs
i
don't
have
to
weed
through
myriads
of
stuff
to
find
what
my
student
will
can
use
these
are
some
of
the
ways
we
use
mytalk
tools
home
school
and
in
community
order
favorite
foods
when
dining
out
answer
yes
no
class
questions
as
well
as
a

wants
to
watch
about
family
contact
information
age
and
school
she
attends
what
recreational
activities
she
enjoys
about
weekend
activities
slp
i
have
used
mytalk
for
my
nonverbal
clients
for
4
years
now
it
has
helped
my
clients
become
more
independent
at
work
and
in
the
community
i
use
the
professional
workspace
to
quickly
make
communication
cells
on
a
variety
of
subjects
wants
and
needs
ordering
in
a
restaurant
activities
to
choose
from
while
at
dayhab
and
at
home
places
to
go
in
the
community
etc
each
board
is
individualized
for
every
client
the
professional
workspace
is
a
breeze
to
use
any
problems
i
have
encountered
only
a
few
times
in
the
4
years
of
use
have
been
quickly
remedied
by
bick
or
kevin
revolutionizes
my
classroom
i
cannot
say
enough
good
things
about
this
app
it
has
opened
doors
in
the
communication
realm
for
my
students
with
significant
disabilities
it
not
only
gives
my

they
didn't

but
engages

this
app
is
easy
to

and
has
countless
customization
options
customer
service
is
amazing
any
issue
i've
ever
had
has
been
swiftly
resolved
by
their
wonderful
staff
like
this
app
i
originally
downloaded
so
much
2
say
and
loved
it
but
did
not
realize
that
it
was
an
ipad
only
but
i
looked
for
an
alternative
and
found
this
i
am
liking
this
app
more
and
more
every
day
my
2
1
2
year
old
grandson
is
picking
it
up
pretty
well
love
it
love
my
talk
its
so
user
friendly
you
can
customize
to
fit
your
needs
an
inexpensive
option
to
allow
your
child
be
able
to
communicate
successfully
my
son
loves
his
my
talk
too
great
aac
option
this
a
a
very
good
app
for
augmentative
communication
the
interface
is
very
well
layed
out
and
there
are
a
lot
of
customizations
that
can
be
implented
to
support
diverse
aac
user
needs
well
conceived
app
the
main
reason
i
like
this
apart
from
very
clean
and
simple
boards
that
are
highly
responsive
is
that
is
intelligently
backed
up
and
synchronized
with
a
web
based
authoring
environment
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
before
the
ipad
is
stolen
dropped
or
missing
with
this
software
you
get
your
new
device
type
in
a
name
and
password
and
voila
your
boards
are
re
downloaded
it's
a
great
concept
there
is
a
bit
of
an
initial
learning
curve
but
once
you
learn
it
it's
pretty
straight
forward
took
me
a
couple
hours
before
i
felt
comfortable
but
now
it
seems
fine
when
there's
a
field
of
2
the
images
are
nice
and
huge
and
fill
most
of
the
space
rather
than
most
apps
where
you're
limited
to
a
tiny
square
also
you
can
create
boards
and
sub
boards
galore
so
the
hierarchy
of
language
starts
to
make
sense
and
become
usable
vs
other
programs
where
it's
a
flat
hierarchy
also
with
this
app
you
can
import
pictures
from
the
web
incredibly
easily
just
by
typing
a
keyword
search
for
examble
we
buy
a
certain
brand
of
yogurt
and
i
typed
that
brand
into
mytalk
mobile's
web
search
and
a
picture
of
the
package
instantly
appeared
well
photographed
clean
etc
i
just
selected
it
and
it
worked
great
for
teachers
and
speech
pathologists
you
can
have
multiple
sets
of
boards
for
multiple
clients
and
copy
and
paste
boards
and
sub
boards
since
boards
are
synced
with
a
web
based
authoriing
workspace
you
can
replicate
these
boards
on
any
iphone
or
ipad
simply
by
typing
in
a
username
and
password
for
example
a
client
can
have
access
to
their
board
on
their
i
device
and
you
can
log
in
as
them
on
your
own
ipad
and
instantly
pull
up
their
board
it's
pretty
cool
they've
really
thought
it
through
the
responsiveness
is
great
as
soon
as
you
press
the
picture
you
hear
the
sound
and
the
picture
blinks
to
give
you
visual
feedback
downsides
1
when
authoring
new
boards
on
the
ipad
seems
slightly
buggy
when
pasting
cells
it
seems
to
create
an
endless
loop
but
you
quickly
figure
out
workarounds
but
it
seems
like
a
lot
of
extra
pointing
and
clicking
2
the
web
authoring
environment
is
great
in
concept
though
it
is
quite
pokey
i
find
it
faster
to
author
on
the
ipad
which
is
ironic
because
they
created
the
web
authoring
environment
to
enable
faster
authoring
i
am
a
speech
pathologist
and
use
this
app
with
a
couple
of
my
pts
i
love
the
affordability
of
this
app
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
you
can't
delete
and
add
cells
on
the
ipad
without
changing
the
whole
board
the
only
way
i've
found
to
delete
and
add
cells
without
changing
the
board
is
using
the
online
workspace
however
it
cost
more
money
every
month
would
continue
to
recommend
this
app
for
my
pts
if
that
could
be
fixed
making
it
easier
to
modify
boards
without
using
workspace
some
of
my
pts
can
barely
afford
the
ipad
plus
app
not
including
the
added
fee
of
workspace
can
we
get
an
update
to
make
adding
and
deleting
cells
easier
