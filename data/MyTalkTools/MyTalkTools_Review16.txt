Love this app 

Bick Pratt and his team of professionals have given one of my students a VOICE! Today I used the Lite version with my non verbal student. Just to see his face light up when he pressed his picture that said his name was priceless! Am anxious to see what else he can tell me with his "new voice"! Thanks for developing an easy to use app. You have designed it perfectly. One can see how many hours you have put into developing it. I like how I can add my voice and own pictures from my photos. The symbolix and public library are also a plus.I also like how the tutorials guide you through the process. My Talk Tools ROCK!
