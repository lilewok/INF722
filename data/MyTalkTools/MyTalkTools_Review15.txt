Teachers of students with severe cognitive disabilities need this one 

I have used MyTalkTools in my classroom for two years. My colleagues have noticed how much more their students interact with curriculum content both on an independent level and a supported level. They have worked at getting iPads and this app into their classroom too. Do go through all the detailed training because this is a very powerful tool and can do a lot without investing a bit of time to understand it you can miss parts that may be very useful. 

With all the push to evaluate teachers on student achievement MyTalkTools can be a wonderful tool to help with communication and assessment of any curriculum if a student doesn't already have a communication device or alternate mode of communication. 

Try it out with Apple TV mirroring on your LCD projector for the whole class to follow along.
