Giving dad his voice back 

I scoured the internet for an app to help my dad communicate despite his aphasia. I am not even sure how I stumbled on this app. It was a little tricky at first getting it set up but I went on a computer and within a few minutes I was happy to be on my way to setting it up. I can make changes remotely and love how my mom and dad can benefit from the changes immediately. I also appreciate a free 30 day trial to see if this continues to be a perfect fit.
