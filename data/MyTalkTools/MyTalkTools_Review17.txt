My Talk Tools Lite 

I am a speech therapist using this app with my adult patients and I have found it an excellent tool to serve as an assistive communication device or as visual support for verbal communication. It is easy to set up and edit and makes use of your own photos, internet searches or icons and recorded speech or text-to-speech. I have found it easy to teach to family members and patients themselves. The technical support is excellent and my questions have been answered quickly and helpfully. I have used the workspace to set up boards for my patients which has been extremely useful.
