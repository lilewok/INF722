word
a
must
have
speech
device
the
proloquo2go
app
on
my
son
device
is
the
best
app
you
can
get
with
my
son
having
down
syndrome
kleinfelter
syndrome
it’s
a
double
whammy
when
it
comes
to
speech
as
both
disabilities
have
speech
problems
and
this
device
with
the
app
helps
my
son
a
lot
i’m
able
to
add
things
like
taking
a
picture
of
his
mom
dad
brothers
and
sister
with
there
names
you
can
take
your
own
pictures
and
add
them
and
pick
a
voice
to
go
with
it
i
even
added
our
phone
number
to
our
pictures
and
added
our
address
you
can
also
delete
items
on
there
you
know
they
will
or
may
not
use
which
i
have
done
i’ve
also
added
certain
favorite
snacks
my
son
likes
foods
people
and
so
on
its
very
easy
to
use
once
you
get
the
hang
of
we’re
what
goes
and
what
each
item
is
under
you
can
even
pick
the
amount
of
pictures
you
want
on
ease
grid
and
the
size
as
well
i
am
so
glad
my
sons
speech
therapist
she
took
care
of
all
the
paper
work
for
my
sons
insurance
to
cover
his
device
the
device
also
comes
with
a
strong
rugged
case
with
a
stand
which
opens
and
closes
and
alphas
a
strong
handle
and
2
different
length
straps
so
you
can
wear
the
device
with
the
app
across
your
body
so
you
don’t
loose
it
i
highly
recommend
this
device
with
the
proloquo2go
app
for
all
kids
and
adults
with
speech
problems
it
has
helped
my
son
a
lot
he
doesn’t
get
frustrated
no
more
when
you
cannot
understand
what
he
says
or
to
others
autistic
adult
i
am
an
autistic
woman
who
was
originally
nonverbal
and
forced
to
speak
in
different
therapies
they
would
drill
me
to
repeat
different
phrases
but
i
felt
like
i
was
saying
nothing
because
i
was
just
repeating
what
other
people
wanted
me
to
say
i
use
all
of
the
different
assistiveware
apps
in
different
communication
situations
they
listened
to
autistic
people
and
converted
our
natural
dialect
and
communications
into
apps
that
really
work
for
us
for
the
first
time
since
i
was
seven
years
old
i
finally
found
my
authentic
autistic
voice
i
am
myself
again
thank
you
autistic
community
and
thank
you
assistiveware
great
app
happy
that
such
an
app
exists
our
toddler
who
we
suspected
to
be
on
the
spectrum
before
his
second
birthday
has
been
using
this
app
for
about
the
past
6
months
he
turned
three
not
long
ago
and
has
been
learning
how
to
communicate
using
the
app
with
the
help
of
his
therapists
i
really
like
that
it
can
be
customized
for
early
learners
such
as
my
toddler
the
only
reason
i
give
it
four
stars
is
because
he
uses
this
app
on
the
ipad
but
for
some
reason
he
has
trouble
swiping
up
down
for
some
reason
even
after
we
try
to
show
him
over
and
over
again
we
were
told
it’s
probably
a
fine
motor
issue
for
now
we
all
swipe
the
page
for
him
to
access
the
rest
of
his
icons
i
would
love
it
if
the
ability
to
swipe
left
to
right
were
included
since
he
is
able
to
do
that
with
no
problem
crucial
app
my
granddaughter
is
essentially
non
verbal
for
years
11
to
be
exact
we
have
tried
to
give
her
a
voice
we
thought
because
she
can
repeat
that
she
would
eventually
began
to
talk
to
our
dismay
it
did
not
happen
finally
with
the
advice
from
a
girlfriend
i
decided
she
needed
a
communication
device
i
purchased
a
ipad
mini
and
loaded
proloquo2go
on
it
she
is
picking
it
up
fairly
well
to
my
delight
this
program
on
the
recommended
intermediate
is
so
expansive
i
love
how
you
can
customize
it
i
wish
i
had
done
this
years
ago
because
we
would
be
on
a
better
speech
ground
by
now
please
to
all
who
have
similar
circumstances
do
not
delay
whether
the
child
has
speech
or
not
make
the
worthwhile
purchase
of
a
speech
program
this
program
is
certainly
affordable
and
can
be
utilized
into
adulthood
very
simple
to
manage
this
app
is
extremely
versatile
you
can
use
a
library
of
pictures
take
pictures
from
within
the
app
and
even
choose
photos
from
your
device’s
album
there
are
multiple
voices
avail
which
you
can
customize
the
characteristics
of
each
you
can
make
it
as
simple
or
complex
as
you
want
we
started
with
just
a
few
icons
for
our
cognitively
disabled
son
and
gradually
increased
the
grid
to
currently
like
6x8
grid
of
icons
he
knows
it’s
layout
better
than
we
do
this
is
an
awesome
app
with
awesome
support
both
through
developer
and
a
facebook
users
support
page
i
highly
recommend
this
app
if
you
feel
your
ipad
is
not
loud
enough
with
a
protective
case
there
are
amplified
ipad
cases
you
can
buy
elsewhere
best
communication
app
available
i
use
the
app
i
totally
recommend
it
the
app
is
the
best
one
out
there
for
communication
and
has
so
many
voices
you
can
add
your
own
images
other
ones
i’ve
seen
the
voices
are
seoprate
the
app
is
easy
to
navigate
and
figure
out
you
can
add
words
change
pronounces
which
i
love
you
can
add
folders
which
is
helped
me
figure
out
were
all
of
the
things
are
though
i
use
this
to
communicate
becuase
i
cant
speak
its
the
perfect
app
though
not
that
expensive
compared
to
the
other
ones
i’ve
see
the
only
thing
i
wish
that
i
could
turn
off
is
the
news
for
the
app
since
it
drives
me
crazy
to
get
notifications
about
new
update
please
make
a
setting
to
turn
that
off
other
than
that
it’s
good
app
so
versatile
in
helping
my
loved
one
communicate
my
niece
has
had
proloquo2go
since
she
was
5
heading
in
to
kindergarten
she
is
now
14
ready
to
start
high
school
at
5
years
old
this
app
helped
her
communicate
her
wants
and
spared
all
of
us
the
frustration
of
playing
20
questions
in
order
to
figure
out
what
she
needed
or
wanted
it
has
only
grown
since
then
it
has
helped
her
speech
she
often
tries
to
repeat
what
she
has
made
it
say
for
her
lately
she
types
into
the
app
and
listens
to
it
speak
what
she
has
typed
she
loves
telling
me
what
to
add
to
it
and
what
pictures
she
wants
used
for
each
button
proloquo2go
is
one
of
her
best
tools
that
assist
her
speech
and
communication
thank
you
a
positive
behavior
modifier
and
freedom
giver
as
a
multi
disabled
woman
who
is
nonverbal
deaf
partially
blind
mild
autistic
and
slightly
physically
disabled
i
found
this
app
proloquo2go
a
helpful
in
modifying
my
behavior
to
match
my
age
in
a
positive
way
and
liberates
me
from
using
communication
partner
the
interpreter
by
giving
me
the
degree
of
freedom
to
communicate
with
the
hearing
people
while
i
am
on
trip
for
various
activities
such
as
shopping
this
app
was
very
helpful
in
preparing
me
for
open
our
world
to
prove
that
i
can
freely
communicate
with
whoever
as
i
am
on
go
i
believe
this
app
has
given
me
the
increased
degree
of
independence
of
communication
and
social
time
it
has
given
me
many
positive
avenues
for
shaping
my
future
life
through
undergo
a
positive
behavior
modification
and
positive
social
time
a
voice
for
k
we
have
been
using
this
app
for
7
years
and
love
it
we
appreciate
how
easy
it
is
to
program
and
use
i
researched
for
several
months
before
making
the
purchase
for
home
use
this
was
the
highest
recommended
at
the
time
our
son
is
20
and
non
verbal
unless
prompted
to
say
something
he
quickly
figured
out
he
could
make
food
and
beverage
choices
which
was
very
motivating
for
him
we
even
have
it
programmed
for
fast
food
choices
he
also
uses
it
to
select
leisure
activity
choices
i
highly
recommend
this
app
our
previous
device
was
heavy
slow
to
start
and
cost
"7,000"
the
ipad
app
and
protective
case
was
well
under
"1,000"
life
changing
i
am
a
verbal
autistic
and
schizophrenia
spectrum
college
student
who
is
more
and
more
frequently
losing
speech
and
has
what
appears
to
be
progressive
cognitive
disability
proloquo2go
has
been
a
life
changer
i
frequently
use
it
to
talk
to
my
friends
over
discord
by
constructing
my
messages
on
it
and
reading
replies
on
a
different
device
i
also
use
it
to
talk
to
my
roommates
and
i'm
slowly
getting
the
courage
to
use
it
in
more
and
more
situations
my
only
criticism
is
i
wish
it
had
a
dark
mode
or
a
dimmer
background
since
the
white
hurts
my
eyes
and
exacerbates
my
tics
after
a
while
highly
recommend
worth
every
penny
