Life Changing 

I am a verbal autistic and schizophrenia-spectrum college student who is more and more frequently losing speech and has what appears to be progressive cognitive disability. Proloquo2Go has been a life changer. I frequently use it to talk to my friends over Discord by constructing my messages on it and reading replies on a different device. I also use it to talk to my roommates, and I'm slowly getting the courage to use it in more and more situations. My only criticism is I wish it had a dark mode or a dimmer background, since the white hurts my eyes and exacerbates my tics after a while. Highly recommend, worth every penny.
