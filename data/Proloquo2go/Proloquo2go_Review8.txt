A voice for K. 

We have been using this app for 7 years and love it! We appreciate how easy it is to program and use. I researched for several months before making the purchase for home use. This was the highest recommended at the time. Our son is 20 and non verbal unless prompted to say something. He quickly figured out he could make food and beverage choices which was very motivating for him. We even have it programmed for fast food choices. He also uses it to select leisure activity choices. 

I highly recommend this app! Our previous device was heavy, slow to start and cost $7,000. The iPad, app and protective case was well under $1,000.
