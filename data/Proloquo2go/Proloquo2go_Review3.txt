Crucial app 

My granddaughter is essentially non-verbal. For years, 11 to be exact, we have tried to give her a voice. We thought because she can repeat that she would eventually began to talk. To our dismay it did not happen. Finally with the advice from a girlfriend I decided she needed a communication device. I purchased a iPad mini and loaded Proloquo2Go on it. She is picking it up fairly well to my delight. This program on the recommended intermediate is so expansive. I love how you can customize it. I wish I had done this years ago because we would be on a better speech ground by now. Please to all who have similar circumstances do not delay whether the child has speech or not make the worthwhile purchase of a speech program. This program is certainly affordable and can be utilized into adulthood!!
