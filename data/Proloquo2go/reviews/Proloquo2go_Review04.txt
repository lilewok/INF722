Very simple to manage! 

This app is extremely versatile. You can use a library of pictures, take pictures from within the app, and even choose photos from your device’s album. There are multiple voices avail which you can customize the characteristics of each. You can make it as simple or complex as you want. We started with just a few icons for our cognitively disabled son and gradually increased the grid to (currently) like 6x8 grid of icons. He knows it’s layout better than we do. 

This is an awesome app with awesome support both through developer and a Facebook users support page! I highly recommend this app. 

If you feel your iPad is not loud enough with a protective case, there are amplified iPad cases you can buy elsewhere.
