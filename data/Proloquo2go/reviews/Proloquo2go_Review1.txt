A must have speech device 

The Proloquo2Go app on my son device is the best app you can get,with my son having Down Syndrome & Kleinfelter Syndrome it’s a double whammy when it comes to speech as both disabilities have speech problems and this device with the app helps my son a lot I’m able to add things like taking a picture of his mom,dad ,brothers and sister with there names you can take your own pictures and add them and pick a voice to go with it ,I even added our phone number to our pictures and added our address ,you can also delete items on there you know they will or may not use which I have done I’ve also added certain favorite snacks my son likes,foods,people and so on its very easy to use once you get the hang of we’re what goes and what each item is under you can even pick the amount of pictures you want on ease grid and the size as well ,I am so glad my sons speech therapist she took care of all the paper work for my sons insurance to cover his device ,the device also comes with a strong rugged case with a stand which opens and closes and alphas a strong handle and 2 different length straps so you can wear the device with the app across your body so you don’t loose it,I highly recommend this device with the proloquo2go app for all kids and adults with Speech problems it has helped my son a lot he doesn’t get frustrated no more when you cannot understand what he says or to others.
