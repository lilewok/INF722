A Positive Behavior Modifier and Freedom Giver 

As a multi-disabled woman who is nonverbal, deaf, partially blind, mild autistic and slightly physically disabled, I found this app, Proloquo2Go a helpful in modifying my behavior to match my age in a positive way and liberates me from using communication partner (the interpreter) by giving me the degree of freedom to communicate with the hearing people while I am on trip for various activities such as shopping. This app was very helpful in preparing me for open our world to prove that I can freely communicate with whoever as I am on go. I believe this app has given me the increased degree of independence of communication and social time. It has given me many positive avenues for shaping my future life through undergo a positive behavior modification and positive social time.
