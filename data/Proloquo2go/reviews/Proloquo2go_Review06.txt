So versatile in helping my loved one communicate! 

My niece has had Proloquo2Go since she was 5, heading in to kindergarten. She is now 14, ready to start high school. At 5 years old, this app helped her communicate her wants and spared all of us the frustration of playing 20 questions in order to figure out what she needed or wanted. It has only grown since then. It has helped her speech. She often tries to repeat what she has made it say for her. Lately, she types into the app and listens to it speak what she has typed. She loves telling me what to add to it and what pictures she wants used for each button. Proloquo2Go is one of her best tools that assist her speech and communication. Thank you!
