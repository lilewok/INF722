Great app! 

Happy that such an app exists. Our toddler who we suspected to be on the spectrum before his second birthday has been using this app for about the past 6 months. He turned three not long ago and has been learning how to communicate using the app with the help of his therapists. I really like that it can be customized for early learners such as my toddler. The only reason I give it four stars is because he uses this app on the iPad, but for some reason he has trouble swiping up/down for some reason even after we try to show him over and over again. We were told itâ€™s probably a fine motor issue. For now, we all swipe the page for him to access the rest of his icons. I would love it if the ability to swipe left to right were included since he is able to do that with no problem.
