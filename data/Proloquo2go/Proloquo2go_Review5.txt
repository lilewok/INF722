Best communication app available 

I use the app I totally recommend it! The app is the best one out there for communication and has so many voices you can add your own images other ones I’ve seen the voices are seoprate the app is easy to navigate and figure out you can add words change pronounces which I love you can add folders which is helped me figure out were all of the things are though. I use this to communicate becuase I cant speak its the perfect app though not that expensive compared to the other ones I’ve see. The only thing I wish that I could turn off is the news for the app since it drives me crazy to get notifications about new update please make a setting to turn that off other than that it’s good app
