word
touchchathd
is
the
first
app
i
try
with
my
nonverbal
or
limited
verbal
special
education
students
it’s
very
intuitive
and
helps
reduce
frustration
by
assisting
navigation
for
new
users
for
example
if
a
person
presses
the
eat
button
it
automatically
without
extra
programming
jumps
to
the
food
home
page
to
select
the
food
it
has
lots
of
levels
for
all
types
of
aac
users
my
only
complaints
would
be
1
the
vocabulary
layout
is
not
consistent
across
levels
so
that
if
a
user
is
ready
to
progress
to
a
level
with
more
robust
vocabulary
and
buttons
the
layout
of
main
buttons
changes
drastically
which
makes
the
user
relearn
basic
motor
patterns
for
example
the
home
button
may
move
from
the
bottom
corner
to
the
top
corner
or
the
clear
button
moves
from
the
lower
bottom
corner
to
the
opposite
top
corner
2
the
app
saves
an
image
of
the
logo
to
the
device’s
camera
roll
every
day
the
app
is
used
this
is
a
minor
annoyance
but
i
have
never
seen
another
app
do
this
and
it
gets
old
deleting
the
logo
every
day
i
like
using
it’s
useful
as
i
cannot
talk
but
since
the
last
update
the
interrupt
function
has
stopped
working
so
if
you
accidentally
hit
the
speak
button
or
speech
display
bar
a
second
time
you
and
whoever
you
are
with
has
to
listen
to
the
whole
message
again
you
can
hit
the
home
button
and
close
the
app
but
then
when
you
come
back
to
the
app
it
will
continue
what
it
did
not
finish
can
you
bring
back
the
interrupt
touchchat
with
word
power
is
versatile
and
very
intuitive
every
single
teacher
of
students
using
it
love
it
because
it
is
easy
to
find
icon
locations
and
very
little
programming
is
needed
because
the
vocabulary
layout
mimics
naturally
occurring
speech
so
much
easier
to
use
than
proloquo2go
my
students
are
initiating
so
much
more
communication
with
touchchat
with
the
latest
update
unable
to
use
program
when
picking
pictures
no
longer
jumps
to
the
pages
and
there
is
no
sound
i
have
tested
the
voice
under
page
editor
that
work
unable
to
find
troubleshooting
under
help
page
help
please
please
fix
the
glitches
from
the
newest
update
screen
freezes
and
then
turns
blank
my
son
relies
on
this
app
for
communication
and
this
is
incredibly
frustrating
disappointed
with
this
purchase
as
it
only
works
on
the
ipad
for
the
price
there
are
better
apps
out
there
that
only
cost
a
little
more
that
are
compatible
across
multiple
devices
and
have
way
better
reviews
also
the
lack
of
the
picture
in
addition
to
the
word
going
up
into
the
sentence
strip
is
a
major
drawback
when
i
did
deal
with
customer
service
they
were
less
than
helpful
