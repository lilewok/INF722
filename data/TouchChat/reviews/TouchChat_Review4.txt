Please fix the glitches from the newest update! Screen freezes and then turns blank. My son relies on this app for communication and this is incredibly frustrating!
Disappointed with this purchase as it only works on the iPad. For the price there are better apps out there that only cost a little more that are compatible across multiple devices and have way better reviews. Also the lack of the picture in addition to the word going up into the sentence strip is a major drawback.
When I did deal with Customer Service they were less than helpful.
