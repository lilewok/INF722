TouchChat with word power is versatile and very intuitive. Every single teacher of students using it love it because it is easy to find icon locations and very little programming is needed because the vocabulary layout mimics naturally occurring speech. So much easier to use than Proloquo2Go. My students are initiating so much more communication with TouchChat.
