what
my
autistic
child
needs
who
has
stronger
reading
skills
than
expressive
skills

promised
it's
simple
quick
to
talk
and
gives
the
user
the
option
to
create
complete
sentences
which
my
child
can
read
aloud
to
that
other
apps
don't
have
but
there
are
too
many
limitations
glitches

content
in
order
to
do
that
thank
you
for
your
consideration
i
am
willing
to
pay
extra
for
the
requested
updates
a
great
and
simple
to
use
app
the
ability
to
communicate
is
an
essential
life
skill
to
have
it
is
important
for
my
students
with
communication
difficulties
to
be
able
to
communicate
basic
needs
and
wants
independently
it
is
also
important
for
my
students
to
have
engaging
conversations
with
their
peers
quick
talk
facilitates
this
experience
where
my
students
can
do
both
my
students
with
low
muscle
tone
and
who
have
trouble
coordinating
the
muscles
find
the
two
option
layout
in
quick
talk
easier
to
access
and
navigate
information
independently
the
students
begin
by
personalizing
their
quick
talk
settings
practice
accessing
their
desired
information
with
help
and
then
work
towards
accessing
the
information
on
their
own
quick
talk
also
facilitates
a
natural
flow
of
conversation
between
peers
and
staff
some
students
won't
stay
long
enough
to
hear
what
the
student
with
communication
difficulties
has
to
say
using
quick
talk
students
can
access
their
information
faster
allowing
the
students
to
engage
in
longer
conversations
the
arrows
on
the
screen
are
a
helpful
visual
tool
for
the
students
to
be
able
o
now
where
to
navigate
throughout
quick
talk
great
app
a
must
have
for
slp's
i
love
this
app
as
a
speech
language
pathologist
i've
seen
many
aac
apps
and
this
is
the
first
that
i've
been
able
to
use
within
minutes
it
took
me
about
5
minutes
to
learn
how
to
program
the
device
and
use
it
i
can
use
it
with
several
of
the
students
on
my
caseload
all
with
varying
degrees
of
communication
challenges
for
yes
no
questions
simple
choices
inclusion
during
circle
times
classroom
participation
and
more
i
don't
have
to
switch
devices
or
apps
i
can
just
use
quick
talk
the
teachers
are
able
to
program
this
app
easily
and
it
doesn't
take
several
training
sessions
to
implement
use
with
their
students
this
app
is
able
to
bridge
the
gap
between
communicating
basic
wants
and
needs
and
complex
phrases
sentences
it's
the
quickest
way
for
providing
someone
with
quick
functional
communication
high
hopes
here
i
am
a
20
year
old
college
student
who
has
been
friends
with
and
has
worked
with
children
young
adults
who
are
verbally
challenged
with
special
needs
for
over
10
years
using
this
app
the
last
few
days
i
am
impressed
with
the
extreme
amount
of
customizability
i
can
really
see
this
becoming
my
friends
main
way
of
communication
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
i
am
very
hopeful
for
this
app
to
be
a
huge
relief
in
communication
already
the
last
3
days
we
have
been
able
to
communicate
much
quicker
and
much
easier
smiling
every
time
we
customize
a
new
box
