A great and simple to use app!!

The ability to communicate is an essential life skill to have. It is important for my students with communication difficulties to be able to communicate basic needs and wants independently. It is also important for my students to have engaging conversations with their peers. Quick Talk facilitates this experience where my students can do both.
My students with low muscle tone and who have trouble coordinating the muscles find the two-option layout in Quick Talk easier to access and navigate information independently. The students begin by personalizing their Quick Talk settings, practice accessing their desired information with help and then work towards accessing the information on their own.
Quick Talk also facilitates a natural flow of conversation between peers and staff. Some students won't stay long enough to hear what the student with communication difficulties has to say. Using Quick Talk, students can access their information faster, allowing the students to engage in longer conversations.
The arrows on the screen are a helpful visual tool for the students to be able o now where to navigate throughout Quick Talk. Great app!!
