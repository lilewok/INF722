A must-have for SLP's

I love this app! As a speech-language pathologist I've seen many AAC apps and this is the first that I've been able to use within minutes. It took me about 5 minutes to learn how to program the device and use it. I can use it with several of the students on my caseload, all with varying degrees of communication challenges, for Yes/No questions, simple choices, inclusion during circle times, classroom participation, and more. I don't have to switch devices or apps, I can just use Quick Talk. The teachers are able to program this app easily and it doesn't take several training sessions to implement use with their students. This app is able to bridge the gap between communicating basic wants and needs and complex phrases/sentences. It's the quickest way for providing someone with quick, functional communication.
