A whole new way to communicate. Quick Talk is designed to be the most flexible, accessible, and affordable AAC solution available.
We are excited about the completely new design of Quick Talk AAC! Working with educators, therapists, engineers, parents, and individuals who are non-verbal, we have developed a communication that anyone can use! Quick Talk was designed with a simple mission - to change the world by giving a voice to those who cannot speak for themselves. Our goal is to make it as quick as possible for you to talk. We made this app as mobile, simple, and flexible as possible, so for one small fee you can have everything you need to communicate. Don't spend your time setting up; spend your time talking!
Quick Talk AAC has been effectively used by individuals with autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy, apraxia, and other special needs, both at home and in a school environment. There is a huge need for an assistive technology that can equip those who are non-verbal with the ability to communicate. Typical Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices and apps are either too expensive or too complicated. We have set out to change this by providing an affordable solution to everyone with access to iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch. We developed Quick Talk with the advice and guidance from experts in speech therapy, educators, and individuals who use AAC devices to pack it full of features, while keeping simplicity and cost in mind. The outcome is a one-of-a-kind app that we believe will change many lives.
We believe Quick Talk is going to make a huge difference in peoples' lives and are committed to its continual improvement. Please email us any suggestions you may have about how we can further improve Quick Talk as we take your feedback seriously.

About Digital Scribbler, Inc
Founded by Russ Ewell, Digital Scribbler is a technology company, whose "built in the garage" origin story typifies Silicon Valley. This garage is now more mentality than place. It is a mindset which says, "If we can dream it, we can build it." We dreamed of creating an affordable communication app, which was capable of giving the verbally challenged a voice. It needed to be mobile, simple, and flexible. Quick Talk AAC was the result, and it has been helping those in silence speak ever since.
