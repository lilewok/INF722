Need more improvement

Exactly what my autistic child needs, who has stronger reading skills than expressive skills. As promised, it's simple, quick to talk, and gives the user the option to create complete sentences which my child can read aloud to that other apps don't have. But, there are too many limitations/glitches:
1. Pls remove "new page" label from the Name, Caption, Text-to-Speech fields when adding a New Category, New Page, New Button. Or fade it out and allow us to write over it (eg: Netflix search field). It's a pain to have to backspace or select all/delete when adding info to this page.
2. Please add a delete option that can delete everything in the Name, Caption, Text-to-Speech fields such as creating a "x" delete button.
3. Please include a "Back" or "Cancel" button on the edit pages of the New Category, New Page, and New Button so that I have the option to change my mind about not saving the new changes or not adding a new category/page/button. The only way to back out of the edit page is to hit "save" which then kicks me out of the app completely.
4. Plus, if I don't have any info added to the Name, Caption, Text-to-Speech fields, the app crashes.
5. Every time I try to add a New Category, the app crashes. I have only created 3 categories and the app is already having a hard time handling extras.
6. Please give us an option to choose Not to create categories.
7. Please add an option to copy and paste a Button from one category to another category.
8. Please give user the option to "save to icloud" so that we don't lose all the info we have created when our device crashes, when we change to a new device, when we want to add a new device. Example, the option to use my child's iPod or my iPhone and not carry the bulky iPad with us on trips, and not forced to recreate the content in order to do that.
Thank you for your consideration. I am willing to pay extra for the requested updates.
