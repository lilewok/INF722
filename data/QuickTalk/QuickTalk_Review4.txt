High Hopes Here

I am a 20 year old college student, who has been friends with, and has worked with children/young adults who are verbally challenged with special needs for over 10 years. Using this app the last few days, I am impressed with the extreme amount of customizability. I can really see this becoming my friends main way of communication, in the palm of his hand! I am very hopeful for this app to be a huge relief in communication! Already the last 3 days we have been able to communicate much quicker and much easier, smiling every time we customize a new box!
